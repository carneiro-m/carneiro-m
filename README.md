### Hi there 👋


I am a scientist interested in unraveling the complexity of biological systems and leveraging this understanding to drive innovation in healthcare.

### My learning path 
🧬 I have studied **Biology with an emphasis on Genetics** at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro from 2009 - 2013 🇧🇷
🧫🦠 I then pursued a **Master's in Oncology** at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from 2013 - 2015 🇧🇷
💻📊 And a PhD in **Molecular Biology with an emphasis in Systems Biology** at the University of Montreal from 2017 - 2023 🇨🇦


### How did I start in science?
My research experience started in my first year at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
I was curious about the regulation of gene expression, and to explore this topic, I first joined the lab of Dr. Manoel Luis Costa to work with zebrafish studying myogenesis 🐠🔬💪
I then joined Dr. Carlos Soares' lab to study the symbiotic bacteria *Teredinibacter turnerae*. These bacteria produce bioactive compounds, and for my project, I genetically engineered them to increase the production of bioactive compounds and tested their antimicrobial activity.  

In 2012, I was introduced to immuno-oncology, a field that wasn't very popular at the time. I joined Dr. Martin Bonamino's lab to work on a project to engineer CAR-T cells to treat hematological cancers. 👩🏻‍🔬🧬🧫🦠🐭

The challenges in using CAR-T cells to treat solid tumors motivated me to understand the tumor microenvironment. I then performed my doctorate project at the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center (CRCHUM). 💻📊
